# MarketMint Cryptocurrency Dashboard

## Project Description
MarketMint is an interactive dashboard for real-time cryptocurrency tracking. It allows users to view key cryptocurrency data such as prices, trading volumes, and price trends. Users can select their preferred cryptocurrency, analyze its price changes over different time intervals, and explore comprehensive details displayed in charts, cards, and tables. Designed for traders, crypto enthusiasts, and anyone looking for an intuitive platform to get an overview of the cryptocurrency market.
Crypto data are real, but you can't really buy crypto. It's just a project website, every user profile information is fictional for illustrative purposes only.

*Updates: This is the demo version with only four eligible cryptocurrencies. Soon you will see more!
